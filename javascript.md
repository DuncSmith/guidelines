# Coding standards for JavaScript

Welcome to our coding standards for writing JavaScript, jQuery, Backbone and Beyond.

## Coding style

* Use spaces instead of tabs with a 2 space indent
* Use multiple lines for multiple selectors
* Use double quotes `"` instead of single quotes `'` around strings where possible
* Our naming convention is camelCase (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CamelCase) when naming variables and methods
* Files should be named in Snake_Case to match the Ruby File Structure

## Preference for new files

In general all new JavaScript written for our apps should be written using the BackboneJS (http://backbonejs.org/) library/structure of models, views and collections.

## Tests

All new models and collections should have an associated Jasmine test.  For more information speak to a Front-End Dev.
